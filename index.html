                    <b>Paranormal</b> events are purported phenomena described in popular culture, folk, and other non-scientific 
                     bodies of knowledge, whose existence within these contexts is described as being beyond the scope of normal
                    scientific understanding. Notable paranormal beliefs include those that pertain to extrasensory
                    perception (for example, <u>telepathy</u>), <u>spiritualism</u> and the <u>pseudosciences of ghost hunting</u>,
                   <u>cryptozoology</u>, and <u>ufology</u>.
                </p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;">
                Proposals regarding the paranormal are different from scientific hypotheses or speculations extrapolated 
                from scientific evidence because scientific ideas are grounded in empirical observations and experimental
                data gained through the scientific method.

                <div class="col">
                    <p> Those who argue for the existence of the paranormal explicitly do not base their arguments 
                    on empirical evidence but rather on anecdote, testimony, and suspicion.

                         phenomena is usually a 
                         misinterpretation, misunderstanding, or anomalous variation of natural phenomena.

            <h3 style="font-size: 16.5px;">Ghost Hunting</h3>

            <br>

            <p>
                <b>Ghost Hunting</b> is the process of investigating locations that are reported to be haunted by ghosts. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Typically, a ghost-hunting team will attempt to collect evidence supporting the existence of paranormal 
                activity. Ghost hunters use a variety of electronic devices, including <u>EMF meters </u>, <u>digital thermometers</u>, 
                both handheld and static <u>digital video cameras</u>, including <u>thermographic</u> and <u>night vision cameras</u>, <u>night 
                vision goggles</u>, as well as <u>digital audio recorders</u>.
            </p>

            <br>


            <p>
                Other more traditional techniques are also used, such as conducting interviews and researching the
                history of allegedly haunted sites. <u> Ghost hunters may also refer to themselves as "<b>paranormal 
                investigators</b>." </u>
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Ghost hunting has been heavily criticized for its dismissal of the scientific method. No scientific 
                study has ever been able to confirm the existence of ghosts. The practice is considered a 
                pseudoscience by the vast majority of educators, academics, and science writers.

              <p>
                Harry Price (1881–1948) was a British <u>parapsychologist</u>, psychic researcher and author 
                who gained public prominence for his investigations into psychical phenomena and his exposing of 
                fraudulent <u>spiritualist mediums</u>. He is best known for his well-publicized investigation of the
                purportedly haunted <u>Borley Rectory in Essex, England</u>. Price's exploits were given wide 
                exposure in a 1950 book, Harry Price: Biography of a Ghost Hunter by Paul Tabori. 
                He was also a longstanding member of the <u>Ghost Club based</u> in London.
              </p>

                <br>
              <P>
                Price joined the <U>Society for Psychical Research (SPR)</U> in 1920, and used his 
                knowledge of stage magic to debunk fraudulent mediums. 
              </P>
<br>
                <P>
                    In 1922, he exposed 
                    <u>The "spirit" photographer William Hope</u>. In the same year he traveled to 
                    Germany with Eric Dingwall and investigated <u>Willi Schneider</u> at the home of Baron 
                    Albert von Schrenck-Notzing in Munich. In 1923, Price exposed <u>the medium Jan Guzyk</u>.
                </P>
<br>
                <p>
                    Price wrote that the photographs depicting the ectoplasm of the medium <u>Eva Carrière</u> 
                    taken with Schrenck-Notzing looked artificial and two-dimensional made from cardboard 
                    and newspaper portraits and that there were no scientific controls as both her hands
                    were free. In <u>1920</u> <u>Carrière was investigated by psychical researchers in London</u>. 
                    An analysis of her ectoplasm revealed it to be made of chewed paper. She was also 
                    investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were <mark>negative</mark>.

                <p>
                    In 1925, Price investigated <u>Maria Silbert</u> and <mark>caught her using her feet and toes to 
                    move objects in the séance room</mark>. He also investigated the "direct voice" mediumship
                    of George Valiantine in London. In the séance Valiantine claimed to have contacted the 
                    "spirit" of the composer Luigi Arditi, speaking in Italian. Price wrote down every word 
                    that was attributed to Arditi and <u>they were found to be word-for-word matches in an 
                    <mark>Italian phrase-book</mark> </u>.

                <p><u>Edward Warren Miney</u> (1926–2006) and <u>Lorraine Rita Warren</u> (née Moran, 1927–2019) 
                    were American paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent reports 
                    of haunting from the 1950s to the present. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <u>Edward</u> was a <mark>World War II United States Navy veteran</mark> who became a self-taught

                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>Lorraine</u> professes to be clairvoyant and a light trance medium who worked closely 
                    with her husband. In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic 
                    Research, the <mark>oldest ghost hunting group</mark> in New England.
                </p>
<br>
                <p>
                    The Warrens are best known for their <mark>involvement in the 1976 Amityville Horror case</mark> in 
                    which New York couple <u>George and Kathy Lutz</u> claimed that their house was <b>haunted</b> by a 
                    violent, <b>demonic presence</b> so intense that it eventually drove them out of their home. 
                    The Amityville Horror Conspiracy authors Stephen and Roxanne Kaplan characterized the 
                    case as a "hoax". Lorraine Warren told a reporter for <u>The Express-Times newspaper</u> 
                    that the Amityville Horror was not a hoax. The reported haunting was the basis for the 
                    1977 book <u>The Amityville Horror</u>, which was adapted into the 1979 and 2005 movies of the 
                    same name, while also serving as inspiration for the film series that followed.

                The possibility of extraterrestrial life is not, in itself, a paranormal subject. 
                Many scientists are actively engaged in the search for unicellular life within the 
                Solar System, carrying out studies on the surface of Mars and examining meteors that 
                have fallen to Earth. Projects such as SETI are conducting an astronomical search 
                for radio activity that would show evidence of intelligent life outside the Solar 
                System. Scientific theories of how life developed on Earth allow for the possibility 
                that life also developed on other planets. The paranormal aspect of extraterrestrial 
                life centers largely around the belief in unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the 
                phenomena said to be associated with them.

            </p>
       <br> 
            <p>
                Early in the history of UFO culture, believers divided themselves into two camps. 
                The first held a rather conservative view of the phenomena, interpreting them as 
                unexplained occurrences that merited serious study. They began calling themselves 
                "ufologists" in the 1950s and felt that logical analysis of sighting reports would 
                validate the notion of extraterrestrial visitation.
            
            </p>

<br>
            <p>
                Both secular and spiritual believers describe UFOs as having abilities beyond what 
                are considered possible according to known aerodynamic constraints and physical laws. 
                The transitory events surrounding many UFO sightings preclude any opportunity for the 
                repeat testing required by the scientific method. Acceptance of UFO theories by the 
                larger scientific community is further hindered by the many possible hoaxes associated 
                with UFO culture.
